        "This architecture is a landmark in the development of deep network models . The most prominent contribution is to propose a normalized Batch Normalization layer to unify the output range of the network. It is fixed in a relatively uniform range. If the BN layer is not added, the value range of the network input and output of each layer is greatly different, so the size of the learning rate will be different. The BN layer avoids this situation This accelerates the training of the network and gives the network regular terms to a certain extent , reducing the degree of overfitting of the network. In the subsequent development of network models, most models have more or less added BN layers to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this paper, the BN layer is standardized before being input to the activation function. At the same time, VGG uses 2 3x3 convs instead of 5x5 convs in the inception module to reduce the amount of parameters and speed up the calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithm advantages:\n",
        "1. **Improved learning rate** : In the BN model, a higher learning rate is used to accelerate training convergence, but it will not cause other effects. Because if the scale of each layer is different, then the learning rate required by each layer is different. The scale of the same layer dimension often also needs different learning rates. Usually, the minimum learning is required to ensure the loss function to decrease, but The BN layer keeps the scale of each layer and dimension consistent, so you can directly use a higher learning rate for optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Accelerate the decay of the learning rate** : When training the Inception model, we let the learning rate decrease exponentially. Because our network is faster than Inception, we will increase the speed of reducing the learning rate by 6 times.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Scramble training samples more thoroughly** : We scramble training samples, which can prevent the same samples from appearing in a mini-batch. This can improve the accuracy of the validation set by 1%, which is the advantage of the BN layer as a regular term. In our method, random selection is more effective when the model sees different samples each time.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Prevent bottlenecks in characterization** . The so-called bottleneck of feature description is that a large proportion of features are compressed in the middle layer (such as using a pooling operation). This operation will cause the loss of feature space information and the loss of features. Although the operation of pooling in CNN is important, there are some methods that can be used to avoid this loss as much as possible (I note: later hole convolution operations ).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **The higher the dimensionality of the feature, the faster the training converges** . That is, the independence of features has a great relationship with the speed of model convergence. The more independent features, the more thoroughly the input feature information is decomposed. It is easier to converge if the correlation is strong. Hebbin principle : fire together, wire together.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Reduce the amount of calculation through dimensionality reduction** . In v1, the feature is first reduced by 1x1 convolutional dimensionality reduction. There is a certain correlation between different dimensions. Dimension reduction can be understood as a lossless or low-loss compression. Even if the dimensions are reduced, the correlation can still be used to restore its original information.\n",

Consider the example of a 1x1 convolutional layer used to reduce dimensions before a 3x3 convolutional layer. In the network, we expect the network to be highly correlated between the output neighboring elements at the activation function. Therefore, we can reduce their activation values ​​before aggregation , which should generate similar local expression descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper explores experiments to decompose the network layer into different factors under different settings in order to improve the computational efficiency of the method . Because the Inception network is fully convolutional, each weight value corresponds to a product operation each time it is activated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, any reduction in computational cost will result in a reduction in parameters. This means that we can use some suitable decomposition factors to reduce the parameters and thus speed up the training.\n",

Of course, the 5x5 convolution kernel can obtain more correlations between the information and activation units in the previous network, but under the premise of huge consumption of computing resources, a physical reduction in the size of the convolution kernel still appears.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we still want to know whether a 5x5 convolutional layer can be replaced by a multi-layer convolutional layer with fewer parameters when the input and output sizes are consistent . If we scale the calculation map of 5x5 convolution, we can see that each output is like a small fully connected network sliding on the input window with a size of 5x5. Refer to Figure 1.\n",

For example, using the [3x1 + 1x3] convolution layer. In this case, a single 3x3 convolution has the same receptive field. Refer to Figure 3. This asymmetric method can save [((3x3)-(3 + 3)) / (3x3) = 33%] computing resources, and replacing two 2x2 only saves [11%] Computing resources.\n",

But this situation is not very good in the previous layer, but it can perform better on a medium-sized feature map [mxm, m is between 12 and 20]. In this case, use [1x7 + 7x1] convolutional layer can get a very good result.\n",

        "\n",
        "Traditionally, pooling layers are used in convolutional networks to reduce the size of feature maps . In order to avoid bottlenecks in the expression of spatial information, the number of convolution kernels in the network can be expanded before using max pooling or average pooling.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, for a dxd network layer with K feature maps, to generate a network layer with 2K [d / 2 xd / 2] feature maps, we can use 2K convolution kernels with a step size of 1. Convolution and then add a pooling layer to get it, then this operation requires [2d 2 K 2 ]. But using pooling instead of convolution, the approximate operation is [2 * (d / 2) 2 xK 2 ], which reduces the operation by four times. However, this will cause a description bottleneck, because the feature map is reduced to [(d / 2) 2 xK], which will definitely cause the loss of spatial information on the network. Refer to Figure 9. However, we have adopted a different method to avoid this bottleneck, refer to Figure 10. That is, two parallel channels are used , one is a pooling layer (max or average), the step size is 2, and the other is a convolution layer , and then it is concatenated during output.\n",

        "* Inception v1 network, 1x1, 3x3, 5x5 conv and 3x3 pooling and stacking together, on the one hand, increase the width of the network, and on the other hand, increase the adaptability of the network to scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* The network of v2 has been improved based on v1. On the one hand, the BN layer has been added to reduce the internal covariate shift (the internal neuron's data distribution has changed), so that the output of each layer is normalized to an N (0, 1) Gaussian, on the other hand, learning VGG replaces 5x5 in the inception module with two 3x3 convs, which reduces the number of parameters and speeds up the calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* One of the most important improvements in v3 is Factorization, which decomposes 7x7 into two one-dimensional convolutions (1x7, 7x1), and 3x3 is the same (1x3, 3x1). This benefit can speed up calculations (redundant calculations Capacity can be used to deepen the network), and one conv can be split into two convs, which further increases the network depth and increases the nonlinearity of the network. It is also worth noting that the network input has changed from 224x224 to 299x299, which is more refined. Designed 35x35 / 17x17 / 8x8 modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* v4 studied whether the Inception module combined with the Residual Connection can be improved? It was found that the structure of ResNet can greatly speed up training and improve performance at the same time. An Inception-ResNet v2 network was obtained. At the same time, a deeper and more optimized Inception v4 model was designed to achieve performance comparable to Inception-ResNet v2\n"
